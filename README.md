<h1>What was done in this project?</h1>
<p> This project we were given starter code and were tasked to develop a Deep Q-Learning block of code to achieve a win rate of 100% fo an intelligent agent to complete a maze.</p>

<h1>What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?</h1>
<p>A computer scientist design, develop, and analyze software and hardware that are used to solve complex problems in different industries. This is important as in this day of age, technology is a huge part of out everyday lives so without computer scientists, these issues may never get solved.</p>

<h1>How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?</h1>
<p>As a computer scientist, I solve problems by analyzing the end goal and current problem and then from there I develop a plan on how I would like to solve this problem. If I am unsure of a solution that would work I conduct research to see the best apporach based on the expected outcome.</p>

<h1>What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?</h1>
<p>My ethinical responsibilites to the end user and the organization are that I should not include my own bias into my code, as all humans have their own specific bias, but that I shuold follow the end goals in which the end user intends to use the software. The code I write should be by the guidelines in whjch my organization has outlined and should be written within the industry standards: clean, maintainable, and reuseable.</p.
